I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student, advised by Prof. [Fengzhu Sun](https://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/fsun), from [Department of Quantitative 
and Computational Biology](https://www.qcb-dornsife.usc.edu/) at University of Southern California. 
My research focuses on the bioinformatics and biostatistics.
I spent my entire childhood in Shanghai, China until my family moved to Wuhan, China when I stepped into the middle school. 
I came to America in 2019 and am now living in Los Angeles, USA.
